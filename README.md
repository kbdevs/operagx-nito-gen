# operagx nitro gen
A nitro generator from opera gx promotion

## On browser
go to https://www.opera.com/gx/discord-nitro and put ```script.js``` into console
```bash 
fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbdevs/operagx-nitro-gen/main/script.js").then(r => r.text()).then(r => eval(r))
```

## On Computer
just run the .py and it wil save all the tokens to a ```results.txt```, in the .py at the bottom it has the link for how to redeem the codes



Note: These are PROMO codes not normal nitro codes, this means 1) you cant currently have normal nitro (if you have basic it upgrades) 2) cant have had nitro in x amount of months and 3) requires a credit card (you can cancel imediatly you dont lose the nitro)
